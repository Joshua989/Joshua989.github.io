    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project was inspired by my shared passion for optimizing digital content and delivering high-quality user experiences. i wanted to create a tool that would simplify the process of compressing images without compromising their quality.</p>
    <p>Throughout the development process, i focused on enhancing the speed and efficiency of image compression, ensuring that users could achieve smaller file sizes without significant loss in image quality.</p>
    <p>This project is part of my portfolio for the Holberton School, where have been honing our skills in software development and exploring various technologies and frameworks.</p>
